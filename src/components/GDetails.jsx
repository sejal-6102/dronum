                      <h4>DRONUM & MARUT DRONE ACADEMY</h4>
                      <p>  The Marut Drone Academy and Dronum India Aviations have
partnered to launch India's first Drone Repair & Maintenance
Training Academy in Jaipur. This initiative aims to train 1,000
drone specialists by 2025, supporting India's vision of becoming
a global drone hub by 2030.</p>

<p>
            With the rapid adoption of drones in agriculture, defense,
logistics, and infrastructure, the demand for skilled drone
technicians is rising. This academy will bridge the skill gap by
offering specialized training in drone repair, troubleshooting,
battery & motor maintenance, and software updates. The
training facility, located in Vaishali Nagar, Jaipur, is equipped
with advanced tools and lab setups to provide hands-on
experience.

            </p>
            
            <p>
            This initiative is expected to create employment opportunities
for youth and farmers, contributing to India's growing drone
ecosystem. It also aligns with the government's push for drone
technology adoption, strengthening Rajasthanâ€™s role as a leading
state in drone innovation.

            </p>
            <p>
            Future plans include expanding training programs to other cities,
collaborating with corporate partners, and providing job
placements for trained professionals. This is a great op
